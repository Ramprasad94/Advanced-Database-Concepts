A repository containing the solutions to course assignments and the final project document


Adaptive Query Processing: 
The final project, titled : Adaptive Query Processing is a study of the multiple techniques involved to alter the paradigm of optimization
and then execution of queries. Based on the academic paper published by Amol Deshpande, Zachary Ives and Vijashankar Raman, this study of 
all the techniques involved was a fun but detailed introduction to the efforts put in by researchers to introduce a fundamental shift in
the way queries were bring optimized and executed.

This repository also contains the solutions submitted over the Fall 2015 semester for the course Advanced Database Concepts at 
Indiana University.
